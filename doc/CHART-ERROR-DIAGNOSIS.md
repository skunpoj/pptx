# Chart Error Diagnosis Guide

## Error: `Unexpected token '<', "<!--# Id: "... is not valid JSON`

This error occurs when the server returns HTML instead of JSON. Here's how to diagnose it:

---

## Step 1: Check Browser Console

When you see this error, **immediately** open Browser DevTools:

1. Press **F12** (or Right-click ‚Üí Inspect)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Look for messages like:
   ```
   Expected JSON but got: <!--# Id: ...
   ```
4. This will show you the FIRST 500 characters of what was returned

---

## Step 2: Check Network Tab

1. In DevTools, go to **Network** tab
2. Find the `/api/preview` request (might be red if failed)
3. Click on it
4. Go to **Response** tab
5. You'll see the actual HTML/error page being returned

---

## Step 3: Check Server Logs

Look at your server console (where you ran `node server.js`) for:

```
üìä Preview request received
  Content length: XXX characters
  Provider: anthropic
  Prompt generated, length: XXX
  AI response received, length: XXX
  AI response preview: {...
  Parsed successfully, slides: 6
  üìà Chart slides found: 2
    Chart 1: column - Quarterly Revenue Growth
    Chart 2: pie - Market Share Distribution
‚úÖ Preview validation passed
```

If you see an error instead:
```
‚ùå Preview error: Failed to parse AI response
```

This tells you WHERE the problem is.

## Common Causes

### 1. AI Returned Invalid JSON
**Symptom:** Server logs show "JSON Parse Error"  
**Solution:** The AI's response wasn't valid JSON. Try again or adjust content.

### 2. Server Crashed/Timeout
**Symptom:** HTML error page like "502 Bad Gateway" or "<!--# Id: error-->"  
**Solution:** Server or proxy returned error page. Check server is running.

### 3. Reverse Proxy Error
**Symptom:** nginx/Apache error page with `<!--# SSI -->`  
**Solution:** If using reverse proxy, it returned error instead of proxying to Node.js

### 4. API Key Invalid
**Symptom:** 401 or 403 error from AI provider  
**Solution:** Check API key is correct and has credits

## Temporary Workaround

If charts keep failing, you can temporarily test WITHOUT charts:

1. Use the **üíª Tech** or **üìö Education** examples (no numerical data)
2. These won't trigger chart generation
3. If preview works WITHOUT charts, the issue is chart-specific

---

## Next Steps

**Please provide:**
1. What you see in Browser Console (the "Expected JSON but got:" message)
2. What you see in Server logs (the ‚ùå error line)
3. What example you clicked (Business, Marketing, Healthcare)
4. What AI provider you're using (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)

This will help pinpoint the exact issue!
