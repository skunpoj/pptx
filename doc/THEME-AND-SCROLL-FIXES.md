# Theme Selection & Scroll Fixes

## Issues Fixed âœ…

### 1. âœ… Preview Panel Scrollbar Fixed
**Issue:** The right preview panel needed proper scroll control to prevent overflow beyond the left panel height.

**Solution:**
- Changed `.main-grid` back to `align-items: start` for proper independent sizing
- Added `position: sticky` to `.preview-container` so it stays visible while scrolling
- Set `.preview` to have `max-height: calc(100vh - 180px)` with `overflow-y: auto`
- The preview panel now scrolls internally without extending beyond the viewport

**Result:** The right panel maintains proper height with internal scrolling, preventing content overflow.

### 2. âœ… Pre-Selection of Color Theme
**Issue:** Users could not select a color theme BEFORE generating the preview. The theme selector only appeared AFTER preview generation, which meant colors couldn't be pre-defined.

**Solution:**

#### Frontend Changes:

1. **HTML (`public/index.html`)**
   - Removed `display: none;` from theme selector - now visible by default
   - Updated description text to indicate users can pre-select themes
   - Hidden the "AI Suggested" badge initially (shows only when AI makes a suggestion)

2. **App Initialization (`public/js/app.js`)**
   - Added `initializeThemeSelector()` function to run on page load
   - Displays all available color themes immediately
   - Restores previously selected theme from `localStorage`
   - Users can now select themes before any content generation

3. **Theme Management (`public/js/themes.js`)**
   - Updated `selectTheme()` to work with or without slide data
   - Saves selected theme to `localStorage` for persistence
   - Shows appropriate status message based on whether slides exist yet
   - Fixed theme selection state to properly reference `window.selectedTheme`

4. **API Logic (`public/js/api.js`)**
   - **Priority order for theme selection:**
     1. **User's pre-selected theme** (highest priority)
     2. AI-suggested theme (if no pre-selection)
     3. Default theme (fallback)
   - Auto-selects AI suggestion only if user hasn't made a choice
   - Updates theme selector display to show AI suggestion alongside user's choice

#### Workflow Now:

```
Page Load â†’ Show All Themes
    â†“
User Selects Theme (Optional)
    â†“
User Enters Content
    â†“
Click "Preview Slides" â†’ AI Generates Content with Selected Theme
    â†“
AI May Suggest Different Theme (shown with âœ¨ badge)
    â†“
User Can Change Theme Anytime
    â†“
Generate PowerPoint with Final Theme
```
