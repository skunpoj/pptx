# Project Rules - Always Applied

## Critical Rules That Must Be Followed

### 1. Summary Creation Rule
- **NEVER** create comprehensive summaries without explicit user instruction
- **NEVER** create summary automatically except when instructed by the user
- Only provide summaries when explicitly requested

### 2. Environment Rule
- We are able to use and test via dockerfile over the internet on the prod env only
- This is the only testing environment available

### 3. User Instruction Priority
- Always follow user instructions exactly
- Do not assume what the user wants
- Ask for clarification if needed

## How to Use These Rules

These rules should be:
1. **Always applied** to every interaction with this codebase
2. **Never forgotten** - they are project-specific requirements
3. **Referenced** when making decisions about output format
