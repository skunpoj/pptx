# UI Fixes Summary

## All 4 Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

### 1. ‚úÖ Preview Section Height Fixed
**Issue:** The preview section's vertical height was too short compared to the left panel.

**Solution:** Modified `public/css/styles.css`
- Changed `.preview-container` to have `min-height: 800px` (removed max-height restrictions)
- Changed `.preview` to have `min-height: 700px` (removed conflicting max-height)
- This ensures the preview panel matches the height of the left content panel

**Files Modified:**
- `public/css/styles.css` (lines 302-322)

### 2. ‚úÖ Fixed "theme is not defined" Error
**Issue:** Error occurred when trying to display preview because `theme` was undefined.

**Root Cause:** In `api.js` line 81, `displayPreview(slideData)` was called with `slideData` instead of `window.currentSlideData`, which had the `designTheme` property properly set.

**Solutions:**
1. **Fixed api.js** - Changed to use `window.currentSlideData` instead of `slideData`
2. **Enhanced theme selection logic** - Added proper handling for:
   - User-selected themes
   - AI-suggested themes  
   - Fallback to default theme
3. **Added defensive check in preview.js** - Added validation to ensure `designTheme` exists before rendering, with automatic fallback to default theme

**Files Modified:**
- `public/js/api.js` (lines 63-96)
- `public/js/preview.js` (lines 14-42)

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Color Palette Moved to Content Creation Section
**Issue:** Color palette selector appeared after the preview slide section, making it disconnected from the content creation workflow.

**Solution:** Moved the theme selector from the right preview panel to the left content panel
- Theme selector now appears between the content textarea and status area
- Users can select colors before previewing slides
- More intuitive workflow: Content ‚Üí Theme ‚Üí Preview ‚Üí Generate

**Files Modified:**
- `public/index.html` (moved theme selector from lines 127-137 to lines 95-105)

---

### 4. ‚úÖ AI Prompt Button Now Works
**Issue:** Clicking the "AI Prompts" tab button did nothing because `switchSettingsTab` function was not defined.

**Root Cause:** The function existed only in the old backup file but was missing from the current codebase.

**Solution:** Added `switchSettingsTab` function to `public/js/ui.js`
- Properly handles tab switching between "API Keys" and "AI Prompts"
- Updates button styles to show active tab
- Shows/hides appropriate content sections
- Exported as `window.switchSettingsTab`

**Files Modified:**
- `public/js/ui.js` (lines 133-174)
