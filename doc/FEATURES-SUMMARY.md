## Important Notes

### ⚠️ Network/Firewall Issues
Remember: The shareable links feature works perfectly **locally** (`localhost:3000`), but if you try to use the external `pptx.coder.garden` service, Zscaler will still block it.

**Solution:** Run locally for best results:
```bash
npm start
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### 💾 Data Storage
Currently uses **in-memory storage** (development mode):
- ✅ Fast and simple
- ⚠️ Data lost on server restart
- ⚠️ Links expire after 7 days
- 💡 For production: Use database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)

   - Generate a presentation
   - Click "View Online"
   - Navigate with arrow keys

2. **Create a shareable link:**

3. **Modify a slide:**

   - Save changes

4. **Share with others:**
   - Send the share URL

   - No login required!

## Summary

- ✅ Beautiful online viewer
