# Testing Guide for Multi-Provider Update

## What Was Fixed

### Issue #1: API Section Not Collapsible ‚úÖ
**Before:** The API section was always visible and took up screen space.
**After:** Click the "üîë API Configuration" header to collapse/expand it. Your preference is saved.

### Issue #2: Only Anthropic Support ‚úÖ
**Before:** Only Anthropic API keys were supported.
**After:** Now supports 4 providers: Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, and OpenRouter.

### Issue #3: AI Ignoring User Prompts üéØ (CRITICAL FIX)
**Before:** When you entered your own text, the AI would generate something else (like healthcare examples).
**After:** The AI now creates presentations based EXACTLY on your input text.

6. Collapse it, then refresh the page
7. ‚úÖ Verify: Section stays collapsed after refresh

### 2. Test Multiple Providers

1. In the API Configuration section, you should see 4 provider buttons:
   - Anthropic (selected by default)
   - OpenAI
   - Gemini
   - OpenRouter

2. Click "OpenAI" button
3. ‚úÖ Verify: Button style changes (highlighted)

### 3. Test User Prompt Obedience (MOST IMPORTANT)

This is the critical test to verify the AI respects YOUR content.

#### Test A: Custom Space Topic
1. Clear the text input box
2. Type this exactly:
```
Introduction to Mars Colonization

Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and has long been a target for human colonization. The planet has water ice, a thin atmosphere, and a day length similar to Earth.

Key challenges include radiation exposure, extreme cold temperatures, and lack of breathable atmosphere. Solutions being developed include underground habitats, radiation shielding, and in-situ resource utilization.

SpaceX, NASA, and other organizations are working on transport systems, life support, and sustainable habitats. The timeline for first human landing is estimated around 2030-2040.
```

3. Click "üëÅÔ∏è Preview Slides"
4. ‚úÖ CRITICAL CHECK: Does the title slide say "Mars Colonization" or something about Mars?
5. ‚úÖ CRITICAL CHECK: Do the content slides talk about Mars, radiation, SpaceX, etc.?
6. ‚ùå FAIL if it shows healthcare, business, or any other unrelated topic

#### Test B: Custom Business Topic
1. Clear the text input box
2. Type this:
```
Social Media Strategy for Small Restaurants

Social media is essential for restaurants to reach local customers. Platforms like Instagram and Facebook allow you to showcase your dishes and connect with diners.

Post high-quality food photos, behind-the-scenes content, and customer testimonials. Use local hashtags and geotags to increase discoverability.

Engage with followers by responding to comments and messages promptly. Run promotions and contests to build excitement.

Track metrics like engagement rate, follower growth, and website clicks to measure success.
```

3. Click "üëÅÔ∏è Preview Slides"
4. ‚úÖ CRITICAL CHECK: Title should be about "Social Media" and "Restaurants"
5. ‚úÖ CRITICAL CHECK: Content should mention Instagram, food photos, hashtags, etc.
6. ‚ùå FAIL if it shows generic business topics unrelated to social media for restaurants

#### Test C: Custom Tech Topic
1. Use the AI Prompt Generator
2. Type: "Create a presentation about blockchain technology for beginners"
3. Click "‚ú® Generate Content from Idea"
4. ‚úÖ Verify: Text box fills with content about blockchain
5. Click "üëÅÔ∏è Preview Slides"
6. ‚úÖ CRITICAL CHECK: Preview shows blockchain-related content
7. ‚ùå FAIL if it shows healthcare or other unrelated topics

#### Test D: Verify Example Templates Still Work
1. Click on "üè• Healthcare" example button
2. ‚úÖ Verify: Text loads about healthcare
3. Click "üëÅÔ∏è Preview Slides"
4. ‚úÖ Verify: Slides are about healthcare/mental health
5. This should work because the text IS about healthcare

### 4. Test PowerPoint Generation

1. After successful preview from Test 3A (Mars topic):
2. Click "‚ú® Generate PowerPoint"
3. ‚úÖ Verify: File downloads as "AI-Presentation-Pro.pptx"
4. Open the file in PowerPoint/Google Slides
5. ‚úÖ CRITICAL CHECK: Slides contain Mars content, not healthcare
6. ‚úÖ Verify: Theme colors look appropriate
7. ‚úÖ Verify: Text is readable and well-formatted

### 5. Test Different Providers (If You Have Keys)

#### With Anthropic:
1. Select Anthropic provider
2. Enter valid API key: `sk-ant-api03-...`
3. Click "Save Key"
4. Enter custom text about "Electric Vehicles"
5. Generate preview
6. ‚úÖ Verify: Content is about electric vehicles

#### With OpenAI:
1. Select OpenAI provider
2. Enter valid API key: `sk-...`
3. Click "Save Key"
4. Enter custom text about "Coffee Brewing Methods"
5. Generate preview
6. ‚úÖ Verify: Content is about coffee brewing

#### With Gemini:
1. Select Gemini provider
2. Enter valid API key: `AIza...`
3. Click "Save Key"
4. Enter custom text about "Classical Music Composers"
5. Generate preview
6. ‚úÖ Verify: Content is about classical music

### 6. Edge Cases

#### Test Empty Input:
1. Clear text box completely
2. Click "Preview Slides"
3. ‚úÖ Verify: Error message: "‚ö†Ô∏è Please enter some text!"

#### Test No API Key:
1. Clear localStorage: Open browser console, type `localStorage.clear()`, press Enter
2. Refresh page
3. Try to generate preview without entering API key
4. ‚úÖ Verify: Error message: "‚ö†Ô∏è Please enter your API key first!"

#### Test Very Short Input:
1. Type just: "Dogs"
2. Generate preview
3. ‚úÖ Verify: AI creates a brief presentation about dogs
4. ‚ùå Should NOT be about healthcare or other unrelated topics

#### Test Long Input:
1. Load the "Environment" example (longest one)
2. Generate preview
3. ‚úÖ Verify: Creates 4-8 slides about sustainability
4. ‚úÖ Verify: Slides are concise (not too much text per slide)

## Expected Results Summary

### ‚úÖ PASS Criteria:
1. API section collapses and remembers state
2. All 4 providers are selectable
3. Provider selection persists after refresh
4. **AI creates presentations based on YOUR input text**
5. Mars topic creates Mars presentation (not healthcare)
6. Restaurant topic creates restaurant presentation
7. Downloaded PPTX file contains YOUR content
8. All providers work with valid API keys

### ‚ùå FAIL Indicators:
1. API section doesn't collapse
2. Provider switching doesn't work
3. **AI ignores your text and creates healthcare presentations**
4. **Title slide doesn't match your topic**
5. **Content slides don't match your input**
6. PPTX file has wrong content
7. Errors in browser console

## Troubleshooting

### If AI Still Ignores Your Input:

**Check these:**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Generate a preview
4. Click on the `/api/preview` request
5. Check "Payload" or "Request" tab
6. ‚úÖ Verify: Your actual text is being sent in the "text" field
7. Check "Response" tab
8. ‚úÖ Verify: The returned JSON has slides that match your topic

**Still broken?**
- Try hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
- Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()` in console
- Check server console for errors
- Verify you're using the updated files

### If Provider Switching Broken:

1. Clear localStorage
2. Refresh page
3. Select provider again
4. Enter API key again
5. Test again

### If Collapsible Section Broken:

1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify `toggleApiSection()` function exists
3. Try clearing cache

## What Changed in the Code

### Frontend (public/index.html):
- Added collapsible API section with toggle icon
- Added 4 provider selection buttons
- Added separate API key input for each provider
- Updated all functions to use `getApiKey()` and pass `provider`
- Provider selection UI with visual feedback

### Backend (server.js):
- Created unified `callAI()` function for all providers
- Updated prompts to emphasize "USER'S ACTUAL CONTENT"
- Added support for OpenAI, Gemini, OpenRouter APIs
- All endpoints now accept `provider` parameter
- Better error handling for different API response formats

## Success Indicators

If everything works correctly:
1. ‚úÖ You can collapse/expand API section
2. ‚úÖ You can switch between 4 AI providers
3. ‚úÖ When you type about Mars, you get a Mars presentation
4. ‚úÖ When you type about restaurants, you get a restaurant presentation
5. ‚úÖ Downloaded PPTX files match your input topic
6. ‚úÖ No more mystery healthcare presentations when you didn't ask for them!

The MOST IMPORTANT FIX is #3 - the AI now respects your content instead of generating random topics.
