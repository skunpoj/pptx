# Authentication Features Implementation

## ‚úÖ Completed Changes

### 1. Server-Side Changes (server.js)

#### Added requiresAuth Middleware
```javascript
const { auth, requiresAuth } = require('express-openid-connect');
```

#### Protected Profile Route
```javascript
app.get('/profile', requiresAuth(), (req, res) => {
  res.json(req.oidc.user);
});
```

This route requires authentication and returns the user's profile information.

### 2. User Profile Display in Header

**Location:** Immediately left of the logout button

**Displays:**
- User avatar (from Auth0 profile picture)
- User name or email
- Only visible when user is logged in

**HTML Structure:**
```html
<div id="userInfo" style="display: none; align-items: center; gap: 0.5rem;">
    <img id="userAvatar" src="" alt="User" style="width: 24px; height: 24px; border-radius: 50%; border: 2px solid rgba(102, 126, 234, 0.3);">
    <span id="userName" style="font-weight: 600; color: #667eea; font-size: 0.85rem;"></span>
</div>
```

### 3. Protected Sections (Greyed Out for Non-Logged-In Users)

The following sections are **visible to all users** but **greyed out and disabled for non-logged-in users**:

#### A. AI Idea Generator Section
- Full AI idea generator with file upload
- **Visible but greyed out** when not logged in
- **Fully functional** when logged in
- Element ID: `aiThemeGrid`

#### B. Color Theme Selection
- Theme selector for presentations
- Output file type selection
- **Visible but greyed out** when not logged in
- **Fully functional** when logged in
- Element ID: `themeSelector`

#### Visual Behavior:
- **Not Logged In:** Sections appear greyed out (40% opacity, 60% grayscale) with a "Sign In to Unlock Features" overlay
- **Logged In:** Sections appear normally with full functionality
- Smooth transitions between states
- Clear call-to-action: "Sign In Free" button with benefits message

### 4. Dynamic Authentication State Management

**How It Works:**
1. On page load, JavaScript fetches `/api/user` endpoint
2. Checks if user is authenticated
3. Updates UI elements based on auth state:
   - **Logged In:**
     - Shows user avatar and name
     - Changes button to "Logout"
     - Shows protected sections (AI Idea Generator, Color Themes)
   - **Not Logged In:**
     - Hides user info
     - Shows "Login" button
     - Hides protected sections

**JavaScript Logic:**
```javascript
window.addEventListener('load', async function() {
    const response = await fetch('/api/user');
    const data = await response.json();
    
    if (data.authenticated && data.user) {
        // Display user info
        // Show protected sections
    } else {
        // Hide user info
        // Hide protected sections
    }
});
```

## üîê Authentication Flow

1. Click "üîê Login" button
2. Redirected to Auth0 login page
3. Enter credentials

5. **User info appears** with avatar and name
