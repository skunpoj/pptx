# Fixes and Modifications Applied

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Debug: ENOENT Error Fix
**Issue:** Error when trying to read presentation.pptx file
**Solution:** Added file existence check before attempting to read the generated PPTX file
- Added `fs.access()` check before reading the file
- Better error message showing the exact path where the file should be
- This helps identify if the conversion script failed to create the file

**Location:** `server.js` lines 521-527

### 2. File Upload Integration with Prompt
**Issue:** Separate "Convert Files to Slides" button instead of integrated file attachment
**Solution:** Completely redesigned the file upload workflow
- Removed the standalone file upload button
- Integrated file upload into the AI Content Generator section
- Files can now be attached as optional base content/template
- The prompt controls how files are converted and structured
- When files are attached with a prompt, the prompt guides the conversion
- When files are attached without a prompt, AI uses a default conversion strategy
- Supports PowerPoint files (.pptx) as templates to modify on top of

**Key Changes:**
- Modified the UI to show file upload as an integrated feature (lines 369-374 in `public/index.html`)
- Updated `generateFromPrompt()` function to handle files (lines 952-1064)
- Removed the separate `processUploadedFiles()` function
- Files are now processed with the user's prompt to control behavior

**User Experience:**
- Users can describe their presentation in the prompt field
- Optionally attach files (text, PDF, PowerPoint, etc.)
- The AI uses the prompt to decide how to structure and convert the content
- For PowerPoint files, AI can use them as templates and modify on top

### 3. Updated Placeholder Text
**Issue:** Generic placeholder text
**Solution:** Changed to actual, specific example text
- Old: "Describe your presentation topic here... For example: ..."
- New: "Create a quarterly business review for Q4 2024 showing sales performance, market trends, and strategic initiatives for the executive team. Include data visualizations and action items."

**Location:** `public/index.html` line 367

### 4. Moved API Section to Bottom
**Issue:** API configuration section at the top of the page
**Solution:** Moved the entire API configuration card to the bottom, after the footer
- Better user experience - users see the main functionality first
- API configuration is now below the footer for less clutter
- Still collapsible and maintains all functionality

**Location:** `public/index.html` lines 458-556

## Technical Details

### File Upload Processing Logic
```javascript
// If files are attached with a prompt
finalPrompt = `${userPrompt}\n\nUse the following file content as the base:\n${fileContents}`

// If files are attached without a prompt
finalPrompt = `Analyze and convert the following files into a well-structured presentation with ${numSlides} slides:\n${fileContents}`
```

### Supported File Types
- `.txt` - Plain text files
- `.pdf` - PDF documents
- `.doc`, `.docx` - Word documents
- `.md` - Markdown files
- `.pptx` - PowerPoint files (as templates)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test file upload with prompt:**
   - Attach a text file
   - Add prompt: "Create a technical overview presentation focusing on key features"
   - Verify AI uses the prompt to guide structure

2. **Test file upload without prompt:**
   - Attach files only
   - Verify default conversion behavior

3. **Test PowerPoint template:**
   - Upload a .pptx file
   - Add prompt: "Modify this template to focus on Q4 results"
   - Verify it uses as base template

4. **Test error handling:**
   - Verify proper error messages for missing files
   - Check that ENOENT error is properly caught and reported

## UI/UX Improvements

- Single unified interface for content generation
- Clear explanation that prompt controls file conversion
- Better visual hierarchy with API at bottom
- More intuitive workflow: describe → attach → generate
