1. Use the ACTUAL content provided by the user below
2. Create 4-12 slides total (including title slide)
3. Design in CONSULTANT STYLE with strategic frameworks:
   - Use clear headers and sub-headers
   - Include strategic insights and key takeaways
   - Add visual indicators like arrows (â†’, â‡’, â†”), boxes (â–¡, â– ), and icons (âœ“, â˜…, â—†)
   - Structure content with frameworks (e.g., "Key Drivers â†’", "Impact:", "Next Steps:")
   - Keep bullets concise but impactful (under 15 words each)
3b. POWERPOINT GRAPHICS - Include visual design elements:
   - Specify background shapes: "circle", "rectangle", "roundRect", "triangle"

   - Specify icon placements (use emoji icons like ðŸ’¡, ðŸ“Š, ðŸŽ¯, ðŸš€, ðŸ’°, ðŸ“ˆ, etc.)
   - Include visual separators and section dividers
4. Advanced graphical representation:
   - Use layout types: "bullets", "two-column", "three-column", "framework", "process-flow", "chart"
   - For process flows: use arrows and numbered steps
   - For comparisons: use side-by-side columns with headers
   - For frameworks: use structured sections with visual separators
   - For data/metrics: use charts to visualize trends and comparisons
5. Choose a professional color palette that matches the content theme
5b. SUGGEST A THEME KEY from these options based on content:
   - "corporate-blue": business, corporate, finance

   Add "suggestedThemeKey" field with your recommendation
6. Extract the main title from the user's content for the title slide
7. Include image placeholders if content mentions [IMAGE: ...] with descriptions
8. CREATE CHARTS when content includes:
   - Numerical data, statistics, or metrics
   - Trends over time (quarterly, yearly, monthly data)
   - Comparisons between categories
   - Market share, percentages, or proportions
   - Growth rates, performance metrics, financial data`;
